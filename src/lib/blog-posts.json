        "content": "## Abstract\n\nIn the present time, where everything is moving forward at a rapid pace, identifying proper sentiments in the field of finance is becoming a big challenge for the people, especially those who are engaged in the stock market. It is not challenging due to insufficient data, but because of the language patterns that has been used which the present existing traditional models fail to clarify in a proper and in an accurate manner. Among these challenges, ironic tone and sarcasm are the most problematic part. This article explores why the expressions which are sarcastic in nature are so much common in financial headlines and how such expressions mislead the conventional systems which are based on the sentiment analysis, and also why the mechanism of transformer -based attention allow more reliable detection of ironic market signals.\n\n## Introduction\n\nFinancial headlines or tags are made in order to use them to capture the attention of people instantly. In an ecosystem where a large number of news are present, writers often depend on the tone that has been used. They do not rely on the direct statements, that has been given, to convey deeper knowledge. **Sarcasms**, *ironies* etc are employed frequently to question narratives of the corporate, policy announcements, or overly optimistic market scenes.\n\nHuman readers rarely struggle with these problems. But experienced traders, who are associated in this field for a long period of time, can easily sense when a news headline is mocking overconfident predictions or questioning corporate optimism. For the systems which are automated, however, sarcasm remains one of the big challenges in area of natural language processing.\n\nFor the contexts which are related to financial sentimental analysis, this problem carries real risk. A sarcastic statement or headline which seems to be positive on the surface may actually reflect negative sentiment. When the existing models fail to recognize this, they may create signals that contradict the actual behaviour of market.\n\nThis article tells the role of sarcasm in field of financial journalism, explains why traditional models, which are based on sentiments, struggle with it, and discusses how architectures which are transformer based help address this issue.\n\n## The Role of Sarcasm in Financial News\n\nSarcasm acts as a deliberate function in the field of financial writing. Journalists use it in order to express skepticism for avoiding explicit accusations. It allows one to criticise forecasts, repeated failures etc without damaging the sense of professional neutrality. For example praising a struggling company in an enthusiastic manner may leads to creation of doubts rather than confidence. When markets are continuously exposed to the promises which they made but fail to fulfil, sarcasm becomes the natural way to show frustration. It shows emotional context also. During period of downturns, headlines may sound reassuring while subtly hinting at instability. It is easier for humans to understand this but it is not same in the case of machines. They fail to decode it.\n\n### Why Traditional Sentiment Models Fall Short\n\nThe pre-existing conventional systems mostly depend on surface level indicators. They mostly count the positive and negative words or provide a fixed score of sentiment which is based on predefined dictionaries. If number of positive terms are more, then sentiment is positive and vice versa. Sarcasm disrupts this concept. In this, the sentence which seems to be filled with positive words may actually generate disbelief, criticism or frustration. Rule based systems cannot capture such contradiction. Even ML based models fail because sarcasm mostly depends on context, contrast and expectation rather than on vocabulary alone. In the domain of finance, without proper understanding of context, models misinterpret the sentiment and produce wrong outputs.\n\n## The Impact of Misreading Sarcasm\n\nIn the field of stock market, errors in detection of sarcasm are not trivial. A sarcastic headline incorrectly classified as bullish can trigger signals of buying during the wrong time. Repeated errors of such nature reduce confidence in the sentiment – driven strategies and introduce a lot of chaos during the time of decision making processes.\n\n### Example Logic in JS\n\nHere is how a simple sentiment check might fail:\n\n```javascript\nfunction checkSentiment(text) {\n  const positiveWords = ['growth', 'soar', 'high'];\n  let score = 0;\n  \n  text.split(' ').forEach(word => {\n    if (positiveWords.includes(word)) score++;\n  });\n  \n  // Returns positive for \"Great growth... NOT!\"\n  return score > 0 ? 'Bullish' : 'Bearish';\n}\n```\n\n## Role of Tonal Shifts\n\nSarcasm is less about words as its core is completely based on a tonal construct. It occurs due to the mismatch between the expectations and the expressions. For detecting the sarcasm, it is required to analyse how various parts of a sentence relate to each other. Various patterns like exaggerated praise followed by cautious qualifiers often indicate irony sense. It is difficult for the models to investigate such relationships but become evident when structure of the sentence and the context of the given topic are considered overall. For recognizing the tonal shifts, it is needed that the models must be capable of capturing the long range dependencies and sentence level interactions.\n\n- **Contrast**: Optimistic words with pessimistic context.\n- **Exaggeration**: Over-the-top praise that feels fake.\n- **Context**: Historical failures vs current promises.\n\n## Why Transformers are More Advantageous\n\nThe transformer based prototype are designed in such a way that it can easily model the relationships across the entire sentence in one go. Because of their various mechanisms, they evaluate how every word and phrase influence one another rather isolating the processing text. It allows them to find the contrast and the internal inconsistency. When the optimistic language clashes with the contextual cues, it can infer negative sentiment. Regarding the financial headlines, this capability permits the models to differ genuine confidence from rhetorical optimism that creates concern which the pre existing approaches fail to achieve.\n\n## Attention as a Feature for Extracting the Actual Meaning\n\nAttention mechanisms help in assigning greater importance to the words or phrases that excessively shape the meaning. In the sarcastic content, these are mostly modifiers or contextual references rather than the undisguised sentiment words. By giving focus on such segments, models will start to interpret tone. With time, this will help in getting more accurate results of identification. For the financial text part, attention driven modelling is very much effective at separating the authentic optimism from positivity that seems to appear convincing on the surface but indicates doubt underneath.\n\n## Challenges in Making Sarcasm Aware Models\n\nDespite the presence of advanced features, transformer models are not the complete solution for the problem of sarcasm. Sarcasm is completely subjective and it is influenced by the contexts which are based on cultural and market specific. Language or tone that seems to be ironic in nature in one economic phase may appear sincere in other phrases. Another challenge is the availability of proper data. Direct sarcasm labels are limited, and presence of ironic tone in financial based news is rarely annotated in raw datasets.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSarcasm in headlines, which are financial based, is not a noise but a meaningful information passed through tone. By ignoring it, a lot of sentiment errors and unreliable decision-making will arise. Pre-existing traditional models struggle very much because they depend only on individual words rather than the whole context. Transformer based attention mechanism address this problem by capturing the contrast and intent, allowing the systems to differentiate genuine optimism from skepticism. As markets are continuously becoming narrative-driven, accurate tone interpretation will play a core role in advancing financial sentiment analysis."

        "content": "### ABSTRACT:\n\nDue to scale differences and inconsistencies, analysis of financial data remains extremely difficult despite appearing in abundance. How raw financial data is transformed into reliable and inputs for meaningful and accurate analysis are explored in the given article.\n\n### INTRODUCTION:\n\nFinancial markets have been generating enormous volumes of data every second. The investment decisions and economic policies are continuously shaped by stock prices, interest rates, financial statements belonging to the corporate sector, trading volumes and investment decisions and economic policies which are continuously shaped by macroeconomic indicators. Despite providing unprecedented opportunities for insight, the abundant data also introduces further analytical challenges. Clean analysis is difficult without proper preprocessing because raw financial data is rarely uniform or directly comparable.\n\nData normalisation is one of the most important preprocessing steps in financial analytics. Dramatic differences in scale, unit and statistical behaviour are observed in financial variables. For example, financial ratios such as return on equity may exist on a smaller numerical scale but the revenue figures of the company may be measured in billions. Models can become biased towards large magnitude variables while analysing without adjustment, despite the actual importance of the variables.\n\nWhether financial data is transformed into a consistent or comparable format or not is ensured by normalisation. This allows more focus of the analytical models on meaningful relationships apart from numerical dominance. The importance of normalising financial data, raw datasets and their challenges, popular normalisation techniques and how financial analysis and decision-making are impacted by these methods are discussed in the given article.\n\n### IMBALANCE OF SCALE AND NATURE OF FINANCIAL DATA:\n\nFinancial datasets are characterized by intrinsic variability. Collection of market data, accounting figures and economic indicators happen from different sources which are further reported under different conventions. Wide variation of prices is observed across several asset, dramatic fluctuations of trading volumes are observed between securities and entirely different distributions are often followed by balance sheet items.\n\nProblems in both machine learning and statistical models arise from this kind of scale imbalance. The variables with smaller numerical ranges are often shadowed by the ones having large numerical ranges, despite the former having significant informational value. For instance, volatility or liquidity measures may be dominated by raw market capitalization which further leads to results which are asymmetric.\n\nThis imbalance is corrected by rescaling data into a common framework through normalisation. The appropriate contribution of the variable to analysis, which further improves accuracy, fairness and interpretability across financial models is ensured by it.\n\n### RAW FINANCIAL DATASETS AND ITS COMMON CHALLENGES:\n\nNoise and inconsistencies are frequently observed in raw financial data. Common issues include reporting delays, differences in currencies, values which are missing varying fiscal calendars. Sudden spikes caused by announcements of earning, unexpected economic events and regulatory changes are also included in market data.\n\nMajor challenges are posed by outliers. Averages and variances can be distorted, or analytical results can be misleading due to extreme price movements and unusually high trading volumes. Inflation, evolution of accounting standards and structural market changes affect financial data that can be utilized in the long run.\n\nThe reliability of analysis is significantly reduced by these issues without proper preparation of data and normalisation. These problems are mitigated by improving comparability across time periods and assets and stabilising distributions through clean, normalised data.\n\n### OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL NORMALISATION TECHNIQUES:\n\nFinancial analysis involves the application of several normalisation techniques, each of which serve a different purpose. The values are rescaled into a fix range, typically between zero and one through the Min-max normalisation. This method helps analysts preserve relative differences while ensuring comparability.\n\nBased on mean and standard deviation, data can be transformed using Z score standardisation. The deviation of the values from historical norms are highlighted int this approach and it is also used in analysing returns, performance metrics and risk factors. To manage exponential growth and reduce skewness, market capitalization, price series and volume data often use logarithmic transformations. To limit the influence of extreme outliers, in some cases, robust scaling techniques are recommended.\n\nThe assumptions of the analytical model, the nature of the data and the objectives of the analysis depend on the techniques chosen.\n\n###  NORMALISATION’S ROLE IN FINANCIAL MODELING:\n\nAn important role is played by normalisation in financial modelling. The stability of regression coefficients is improved, and the interpretability of results is enhanced in statistical models. Convergence is sped up through normalised data which further removes disproportionately waiting, large scale features from the models of machine learning algorithms.\n\nFair comparison across assets having volatile profiles and different price levels is allowed by normalised inputs during portfolio construction. The consistent evaluation of behavioural indicators and transaction values are ensured by normalisation in fraud detection models and credit risk.\n\nBoth the robustness and accuracy of the financial models are enhanced by normalisation, which further increases their reliability in real world applications.\n\n### THREATS ASSOCIATED WITH IGNORING NORMALISATION:\n\nSerious analytical errors are consequences of failure to normalise data. Hidden biases in the input data can lead to the failure of the models in the real market despite the models performing apparently well while training. Unknowingly relying on distorted signals by decision makers may lead to scale dominance, not economic reality.\n\nFinancial losses and poor execution are consequences of rapid propagation of such errors, especially in automated, high frequency trading systems. Confidence in data driven strategies are reduced over time due to repeated in accuracies that undermine trust in analytical systems.\n\n### LIMITATIONS AND PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nThoughtful application of normalisation is necessary despite it being essential. Particularly during periods of market stress, rapid changes in financial data distributions are observed over time. Normalised strategies working in stable conditions need to be adjusted especially during volatile phases.\n\nInterpretability is another important consideration. Results become difficult to be explained to stakeholders due to excessive transformation, especially in regulated environments where maintaining transparency is a big task. Mathematical precision with practical clarity must be balanced by analysts.\n\n### NORMALISED DATA IN MODERN FINANCIAL ANALYTICS AND ITS IMPORTANCE:\n\nThe need for consistent and clean data grows stronger as financial analytics become more advanced. Applications such as risk management, algorithmic trading, financially intelligent platforms and forecasting are supported by normalised data.\n\nThe quality of insights is improved, and better strategic decisions are supported by normalisation, which further enables fair comparisons across markets, time horizons and assets. Simply, normalisation is a bridge between meaningful financial understanding and raw data.\n\n### CONCLUSION:\n\nNormalisation of financial data is a core requirement for accurate and clean analysis, despite it being a secondary step. Scale differences, distortions and inconsistencies present in raw datasets can mislead analytical models if not properly dealt with. Analysts can reduce bias, improve model performance and discover genuine patterns with the data through appropriate normalisation. Effective data normalisation will remain a cornerstone of trustworthy and reliable financial analysis, as finance continues to evolve into a data-driven field."

        "content": "### Abstract\n\nIn the past 60 years Multi-Layer Perceptron(MLP) has helped us as the fundamental block of deep learning based on the approximation theorem. Though MLP suffered from a critical lacking of interpretability and require massive parameter often. This article explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Network(KAN) model which was proposed in 2024. This Model was proposed by Andrey Kolmogorov and Vladimir Arnold. Previously MLP placed Fixed Activation functions on nodes but KAN Place Learnable Activation functions on edges. Here we will analyse the mathematical difference between these two architectures by examining the use B-Splines on edge and weights and we will also discuss How KAN offered us promised path towards the \"White Box\" AI that is very much accurate and interpretable.\n\n---\n\n### Introduction\n\n**1. Stagnation of Perceptron**\nThese neural network is built on a mathematical assumption specifically that is the linear combination of Inputs Based on Fixed nonlinearity. In standard MLP, we define a neural computation as:\n$$y = \\sigma \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i + b \\right)$$\n**Here:**\n*   $w_i$ Indicates Learnable Scalar weights.\n*   $\\sigma$ Indicates Fixed activation function.\n\nThese structure Took help From the activation function by making it a static Gatekeeper. This structure results In Black box while universally approximating where Specific contribution of features is calculated by layers of matrix multiplication.\n\n---\n\n**2. Mathematical Foundation**\nTo understand KAN We focused 2 fundamental mathematical theorem.\n*   **Universal Approximation Theorem (MLP Basis):** MLP Calculates that Sum of all nonlinear function can give an approximate result to any continuous functions.\n*   **Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem (KAN Basis):** KAN states that any multivariate continuous function lie on a bounded domain can be represented as a finite composition of multiple univariate functions.\n$$f(\\mathbf{x}) = f(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\sum_{q=0}^{2n} \\Phi_q \\left( \\sum_{p=1}^n \\phi_{q,p}(x_p) \\right)$$\n**In this formula:**\n*   $\\phi_{q,p}$ are univariate functions (functions of a single variable).\n*   $\\Phi_q$ is the aggregation function.\n\n---\n\n### Architecture\nThe first innovation on KAN is by replacing the linear weight with a learnable non-linear function.\n*   **The Activation Age:** In MLP if an `age = X` and `Skills Scales = W`. Then in KAN an `age = X` and transforms it via a function $\\phi(x)$.\n*   **Basic Splines(B-Splines) Implementation:** We cannot learn from an arbitrary function directly from code, so we will approximate these functions by using B-Splines, which are piecewise polynomial functions defined by control points.\nThe learnable function $\\phi(x)$ is expressed as:\n$$\\phi(x) = \\sum_i c_i B_i(x)$$\n**Where:**\n*   $B_i(x)$ are the fixed basis functions (the spline shape).\n*   $c_i$ are the learnable coefficients (control points).\n\n---\n\n### Pseudocode\n```python\n# 2. The KAN Approach (Learnable Edges, Summing Nodes)\nclass KAN_Layer:\n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Step A: Apply Learnable Non-Linear Functions\n        # Instead of multiplying by a scalar 'W', we apply a function 'phi'\n        # 'phi' is built using B-Splines (basis functions)\n        \n        # logic: y = sum(phi(x))\n        \n        # We compute the shape of the function based on learnable coefficients\n        spline_basis = compute_b_splines(x)\n        phi_x = spline_basis * self.spline_coefficients\n        \n        # Step B: Summation\n        # The node simply sums up the incoming function results\n        y = sum(phi_x)\n        return y\n```\n\n---\n\n### Advantages\n1.  **White box interpretability:** We know that every edge is a univariate function that we can see exactly how one input variable affects the other output variable. In MLP Feature interactions are ignored in weight matrices, but KAN allows us to plot one spline shape on every connection. For example, if spline shapes look like a parabola we confirm it is a quadratic relationship; if it shapes like a sinusoidal then we confirm the relationship is periodic.\n2.  **Parameter efficiency:** In Symbolic Regression KAN helps by reaching lower loss values with fewer parameters than MLPs. A small KAN often discovers a physics law where a large MLP only poorly approximates the curve without understanding its structure.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nKAN shows a paradigm shift from learning linear weights to learning functions by using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and B-Splines. KAN offers us a glimpse into the future of interpretable Artificial Intelligence. Though currently training slower than MLPs due to the complexity of calculating splines, they provide a bridge over the gap between deep learning and symbolic mathematics. For an AI engineer studying KAN will help rethink the atomic unit of neural computation."

        "content": "### Abstract\n\nDesigning a website for a huge amount of public involves many challenges. When a website is designed for millions of publics, the developer needs to take care of certain things such as technical literacy of users, capability of user’s device and various other problems which the user may face during the website navigation. Imagine a situation where a parent needs to pay their bill online in the app/website in a crowded place while holding their crying baby. It can frustrate the user if the app/website is not cognitively efficient. This article focuses on technical and psychological foundations required to build a high traffic intensive interface. It mainly focuses on the Cognitive Load theory and “Human Computer Interaction” principles such as Miller’s Law, Hick’s Law and Fitts’s Law to create a design which is accessible, intuitive and scalable to elevate the user’s digital experience.\n\n### Introduction\n\nWhen a developer designs for one, he needs to please only one person. When designing for a client, he needs to please the boardroom. But when designing for public – a diverse, unpredictable and massive number of users, the developer needs to please the human brain in general. The developer needs to keep in mind about the different patience level, internet speeds, device capabilities of the large number of users. If the developer needs to please the human brain, he will have to work not just a designer but act as a cognitive architect.\n\n### Explanation\n\nGiven below are some of the critical concepts and laws that the developer needs to keep in brain while designing –\n\n#### 1. Cognitive Load\n\nIt is amount of energy the human brain needs to spend to navigate the user interface. It is like a fuel needed to run a car. Better mileage equals to high user base of that car. So, in this case, developers need to think about how they can reduce the cognitive load to attract huge number of publics. There are two types of cognitive load –\n\n1.  **Intrinsic Load:** The minimum effort required to achieve a specific goal. The developer can simplify the load but cannot eliminate it completely.\n2.  **Extraneous Load:** The amount of mental effort wasted due to poor user interactive design.\n\n**Ways to fix this issue –**\n\n1.  Keep the user interface design simple and standard.\n2.  Remove any unwanted element.\n3.  Remove extraneous load completely.\n\n#### 2. Hick’s Law\n\nHick’s Law states that the more choices a person is presented with, the more time the person takes to make the decision. For a mass, this becomes critical to choose a option, if the developer gives different options at the same time. They simply become overwhelmed when they see many options, often choose nothing and simply leave.\n\n**Ways to fix this –**\n\n1.  Give only the essential elements needed.\n2.  Try to reduce the number of options if possible.\n3.  Do not show all options at once. Instead break them into steps.\n\n#### 3. Miller’s Law\n\nMiller’s law states that the working memory of average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items at a time. In this case, it means that an average human who is not able to keep a long string of numbers in their memory, they break them into small chunks.\n\n**Ways to fix this –**\n\n1.  Breaking a series of large numbers into small chunks of digestible groups.\n2.  Place all the elements into groups if possible.\n\n#### 4. Fitts’s Law\n\nFitts’s law states that the time required to move to a specific goal depends on the distance to it divided by the size of the target. We can use this law in our designs by simply putting essential elements closer to each other. Keep other non-essential elements away from essential ones.\n\n**Ways to fix this –**\n\n1.  Keep the essential elements bigger in size, predictable and close to each other. Don’t place the across screens that will fail this law.\n2.  For mobile users, place the essential items near the reach of the thumb finger. Don’t place them away from the reach of finger. A simple example is to place the search button of app drawer below the screen to make it easy for thumb to reach.\n\n#### 5. Visual Hierarchy\n\nWhen all information is given at once, users often do not read the full. They only scan some portions and may miss the important ones.\n\n*   **The F pattern:** The pages that are heavily loaded with text, the eye scans the top, skips a bit, moves down, again scans a little bit and then moves down following the left side of the page, making a F-pattern.\n*   **The Z pattern:** The pages that are heavily loaded with images, the eye scans from the top left to the top right, then moves diagonally to the middle, again scans from left to right and eventually moves at the bottom, making a Z pattern.\n\n**Ways to fix this –**\n\n1.  Put the critical value in the top left to right or in dead center.\n2.  Do not place any important value in the bottom right (blind spot) of a page.\n3.  Use heading, bullets and numbers to stop the f pattern.\n\n#### 6. Accessibility\n\nAccessibility is not just a feature; it is the fundamental. Making a website for the mass means it includes various types of personality, various internet speeds and various difficult situations in which the user may need to navigate the website.\n\n**Ways to fix –**\n\n1.  Use high contrast texts\n2.  Use elements which anyone can understand at any time.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhen designing a website for the mass the developer needs to get rid of his/her own preference and should have an empathy for the users using the website. By reducing cognitive load, the developer is able to reduce the mental energy needed by the user to navigate the website. By following Hick’s law, the developer can speed up users’ decision making; by following Miller’s law, users can retain important information and following the Fitts’s law and accessibility standards, users can easily navigate thought the website. The motive of the developer should be to make the website cognitively efficient rather than making it beautiful, which will ultimately result in their experience elevation and satisfaction of the user."

This blog wil give a clear and\ngood understanding on how statistical techniques are performed in the field of\nstock market by highlighting the key characteristics or features, practical\nbased applications and commonly used fearures or tools that provide support\nin data-driven trading and investing strategies.\n\n### Introduction\nThe stock market is very much uncertain as no one can predict what will\nhappen in the future or in the coming days. It is influenced by various\nelements like economic based indicators, performance of finance based\ncorporate societies, worldwide events, and sentiment of investors. As huge\nnumber of trades are occurring everyday , relying solely on speculation is no\nlonger efficient. Statistical data analysis provides a well organized and\nstructured approach to interprete market baed data and reduce uncertainty in\ndecision-making process.\nBy examining the historical movement of prices, returns, and volume patterns,\nstatistics helps the traders, investors and the people who are very much\nengaged with stock market to identify the trends, measure the level of risk and\nevaluate potential results. In today’s data-driven markets, statistical data\nanalysis forms the core of technical based analysis and quantitative based\ntrading. It also forms the foundation of risk management systems.\n\n### Applications of Statistical Data Analysis in the field of Stock Market and\ntrading\n\n1. **Understanding the pattern of market**\nVarious Statistical methods like mean, variance, and standard deviation are\nwidely used for analyzing the prices of stocks and returns. These measures\nhelp the traders and investors to understand and analyze the average\nperformance and price volatility of stocks. It also helps in providing insight into\nhow much stable or risky a stock is.\n2. **Measuring the amount of Risk and Volatility associated with the market\nstocks**\nMeasuring the amount of risk, associated with a particular stock, is a critical\naspect of investing. Statistical functions such as beta, standard deviation, and\nValue at Risk (VaR) help in quantifying the potential losses. They also help in\nproviding a clear market sensitivity. These tools help the investors to evaluate\nthe amount of risk before making final decision regarding investment.\n3. **Identifying the market patterns or trends**\nTime series analysis feature helps in the study of movement of stock price\nover time. Techniques like moving of averages and analysis of trend help in\nassisting the detection of price momentum, market cycles, and possible\nreversals that create the basis of technical trading plans.\n4. **Portfolio Diversification and Optimization**\nMethods like Correlation and covariance analysis help in determining the\nrelationships between different types of stocks or asset classes. By selecting\nthe assets which are associated with weak or negative correlation, investors\nor traders can easily reduce the overall portfolio risk without significantly\naffecting the expected returns.\n5. **Forecasting and Predictive Analysis**\nNumerous Statistical models like regression analysis and ARIMA are widely\nused to predict the prices of future stocks or returns which are based on\nhistorical data. Though predictions are very much probabilistic, they help the\ninvestors in making proper strategy based plans\nThey help in managing the expectations also.\n6. **Role in Algorithmic and Quantitative Trading**\nQuantitative based trading systems are heavily relied on statistical indicators\nand probability models to study or analyze past data, uncover the market\ninefficiencies and automatically execute the trades which are based on the\nreliable statistically confirmed signals.\nCommon Statistical based Tools or features which are used for analyzing the\nStock Market.\nPython – One of the Widely used programming language for analyzing the\nfinancial data, modeling, and backtesting\nR – Very much popular for statistical computation and forecasting of time\nseries\nExcel – Used for basic analysis, tracking of portfolios and regression\nMATLAB – Applied in the field of advanced financial modeling and\nsimulations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nStatistical data analysis is the keystone of analyzing the stock market,\nallowing the market investors to interpret complex market based data with\ngreater clarity. By enabling the risk management, forecasting, and data-driven\nbased strategies, statistics helps in reducing the uncertainty in a market\nenvironment which is very much unpredictable. As technology and availability\nof data are continously evolving the stock markets, statistical data analysis\nwill always remain an essential or vital tool for an informed investment related\ndecision-making.\n\n"

        "content": "### Abstract\n\nLarge Language Models(LLMs) are very powerful models but they often gave a wrong result when they are tasked with something like Retrieval of Real Time Data or Queries which are Domain Specific. In this article we will explore two approaches for overcoming limitations which are Fine Tuning and Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG). Here we will analyse the difference between these two architectures, how we will implement these two strategies and Performance Analysis. In this Paper we will help people to select the optimal strategy to build AI applications which are specifically for context aware based by practical comparisons and pseudocodes.\n\n### Introduction\n\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence(GenAI) follows a law which is that an LLM is very essential to take snapshot of Internet  at that moment when it finished its training. When we ask the base model that what happened yesterday at that event or what is the current scenario on the company’s private files then at that time it will either hallucinate a fact which is totally incorrect or refuse to give any answer.\n\nOur challenge is not just the calling of an API but we have to figure out that how to connect the gap between a Dynamic Model and Frozen Model for private data. Currently based on the two solution our industry is spited.\n\n**RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation) :-** This process looks like we provide an open book exam to our model by retrieving the data which is relevant and then feed it to the prompt.\n\n**Fine Tuning :-** This process is basically we teach our model new information by updating the neural internal weights.\n\nThis article will perfectly describe that which method is very powerful.\n\n### Architectures\n\n**RAG :-** It is not that it will modify any machine learning model but it will combine a generative model with a system which is retriever. When an user ask any question then the system will at first find a vectorial database for specific documents and then it will paste those databases into the context window of the model. The analogy behind it was that it  sounds like we gave a textbook to a student during his exam. So they will not memorize the facts but they should know hoe to rad and find it from the book.\n\nThe Equation is\n\n\n\n$$ Similarity(\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{D}) = \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{Q} \\cdot \\mathbf{D}}{\\|\\mathbf{Q}\\| \\|\\mathbf{D}\\|} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Q_i D_i}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Q_i^2} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} D_i^2}} $$\n\n\n\nHere,\n\n**Q :-** User Query represented as vector.\n\n**D:-** Document in the Vectorial Database.\n\nHere \n\n**Score 1** indicates that those vectors each other are identical which means the context match is perfect.\n\n**Score 0** indicates that those vectors each other are orthogenic which means that there will be no relevance.\n\n**Fine Tuning :-** It works like at first we took a pre trained  model and train it later on small and relevant dataset. So that it will modify the internal weights of the neural network. The analogy behind it is that is sounds like a doctor went to a medical school to teach the subject named Neurology. They will internalize jargon and will remember new information. Now a days the modern approach is that we retrain all the parameters rarely. Now we use Parameter Efficient Fine Turing(PEFT) techniques to freeze our main model and trains only layers which are adaptive. For Example :- LoRA(Low Rank Adaptation).\n\n### The Equation is\n\n\n\n$$ h = W_0 x + \\Delta W x = W_0 x + B A x $$\n\n\n\n**The Explanation:**\n\n\"Where $W_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times k}$ is frozen, $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times r}$, and $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times k}$ are trainable parameters with rank $r \\ll \\min(d, k)$.\n\nHere\n\n**W0 :-** Pre Trained weights\n\n**W :-** Weight Matrix of the model which is pre trained\n\n**A, B :-** Matrices which are rank decomposed.\n\n**x :-** Hidden Laye Input\n\nBy using this formula we can reduce the total number of parameters which are trainable up to 10000 times so that it is possible to Fine-Tune all LLMs on customer GPUs\n\n### Practical Comparison\n\n**RAG :-** The process is that We embed that pdf book into the vector database. For example ChromaDB. The result is when any user ask any question, the system will find that paragraph exactly about the remoted work and will send it to the LLM. The Benefit will be if any change in policy occur we will simply update that pdf from the database. There will be no requirement of training. \n\n**Fine Turing :-** The result will be the answers of the model which gives fluently if the phrasing will match with that data which is trained. But the Problem is that that policy will change on next week so we have to must retain again our model. \n\n### RAG Implementation Concept using LangChain/Python\n\n```python\n\n# 1. Embed the User Query\n\nquery = \"What is the remote work policy?\"\n\nquery_vector = embeddings_model.embed_query(query)\n\n\n\n# 2. Retrieve Relevant Context from Vector DB\n\n# This searches for the most similar text chunks in your database\n\nrelevant_docs = vector_db.similarity_search(query_vector, k=3)\n\n\n\n# 3. Construct the Augmented Prompt\n\ncontext_text = \"\\n\".join([doc.page_content for doc in relevant_docs])\n\nprompt = f\"\"\"\n\nYou are an HR assistant. Answer the question based ONLY on the context below.\n\nContext:\n\n{context_text}\n\nQuestion:\n\n{query}\n\n\"\"\"\n\n\n\n# 4. Generate Answer\n\nresponse = llm.predict(prompt)\n\nprint(response)\n```\n\n\nCritical Analysisthin the RAG pipeline to build it a robust system mostly as possible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nRAG is the best choice for business related applications which required accuracy and current industrial information. But The sophistical choice will be Fine Tuning. It is best for The Teaching Purpose of the model To learn a new language which is specifically in a coding style or in a relevant medical language. As an AI engineer our job should be to combine those tools to avoid usage of a Fine Tuned Model to understand it better for those queries within the RAG pipeline to build it a robust system mostly as possible.\n\n"

        "content": "### ABSTRACT:\n\nA powerful tool in transforming unstructured market opinions and modern retail trading into actionable insights is sentiment analysis. The influence of sentiment driven data on trading decisions and retail investor behavior is explored in this article.\n\n### INTRODUCTION:\n\nMacroeconomic indicators, balance sheets and earning reports no longer drive the markets belonging to the financial sector. Opinions expressed in social media platforms, news articles, analyst commentary and online forums play a critical role in directing market behavior in today’s digitally connected environment. Market sentiment particularly influences the retail traders as they seek more accessible and faster signals to guide their investment decisions. \n\nSentiment analysis consists of machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and techniques of data analytics that interpret opinions, emotions and attitudes expressed in technical data. Classification of information into negative, positive or neutral sentiments provides quantitative measures of collective market psychology to traders. Sentiment analysis serves as a valuable decision-support tool, especially for retail traders who frequently lack access to institutional-grade resources.\n\nThe impact of sentiment analysis on retail trading decisions, sentiment-driven data’s nature, the risk and advantages and its growing importance in modern trading ecosystems are examined in this article.\n\n### SENTIMENT’S ROLE IN FINANCIAL MARKETS:\n\nThe overall attitude of the investors toward any field, be it broader security or a particular market, is reflected by the market sentiment. Psychological and emotional factors like optimism, hype, fear and uncertainty can be captured by sentiment unlike technical or fundamental analysis. Short-term price movements are often driven by these factors, particularly in news-sensitive or high speculative assets. \n\nRetail traders are especially prone to being attacked by sentiment driven trends. Stocks trending on social platforms, news headlines which are viral and influential online opinions have the capability of rapidly shifting between buying and selling behavior. This collective emotion is transformed into structured signals through sentiment analysis which allows traders to better understand the behavior of the crowd instead of relying on intuition. \n\n### SENTIMENT DATA’S SOURCE FOR RETAIL TRADERS:\n\nA vast range of unstructured sources act as the origin of sentiment data. Most influential inputs consist of call transcripts of earnings, Reddit forums, social media platforms like Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) and trading communities on the online platform. The perspectives of different investors, individual traders to professional analysts are reflected in each source. \n\nHowever, the tone and reliability of these sources are of varying nature. Real time market movements may be absent from news sentiment while noise and exaggeration are common properties of social media sentiment which are mostly driven by speculation. These diverse inputs are processed to produce a sentiment score that is timed and balanced. This attempt made by sentiment analysis helped retail traders interpret the sentiment score more effectively.\n\n### SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND ITS IMPACT ON RETAIL TRADING DECISIONS:\n\nThe process of identifying opportunities, managing risk and timing trade by retail traders is significantly impacted by sentiment analysis. Momentum of buying may be encouraged by positive sentiment around a stock whereas selling or caution can be triggered by rising negative sentiment. Before price trends fully develop, sentiment signals often act as early indicators in fast moving markets. Nowadays, sentiment indicators are directly integrated into dashboards by many retail trading platforms which further helps non-expert users in decision making. Sentiment analysis empowers traders to reconsider emotionally driven decisions and validate their strategies. Sentimental data can reduce impulsive training behavior and enhance confidence when combined with fundamental and technical analysis. \n\n### SENTIMENT-DRIVEN TRADING’S RISK AND LIMITATIONS:\n\nSentiment analysis is not without risk, irrespective of its benefits. Retail traders often mistake temporary hype for long-term value, consequently overreacting to short-term sentimental swings. Sentiment indicators often amplify herd behavior which can contribute to sudden crashes and market bubbles.\n\nSentiment models are sensitive to data quality. Sentiment signals can be distorted by misinformation, sarcasm and coordinated online campaigns. Sentiment analysis may produce misleading insights without contextual understanding and proper filtering. So, sentiment must be treated by retail traders as a complementary tool, not as a standalone decision-maker.\n\n### EVOLUTION OF RETAIL TRADING LANDSCAPE AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS:\n\nSentiment analysis continues to gain prominence as trading platforms become more accessible and data driven. Sentiment indicators are becoming increasingly responsive and accurate with advances in real-time data processing and artificial intelligence. The tools that were once exclusive to institutional investors are now possessed by retail traders. \n\nMore informed participation in financial markets is supported by integrated sentiment analysis, which further helps retail traders navigate volatility and uncertainty. Responsible use of sentiment driven insights can bridge the gap between rational decision-making and emotional market behavior.\n\n### CONCLUSION:\n\nRetail trading has been reshaped by sentiment analysis which helps in translating collective market emotions into measurable insights. It influences how retail traders perceive risks and opportunities by capturing opinions from news and social platforms. Overreliance on sentiment analysis can amplify herd behavior and noise despite enhancing decision-making when combined with traditional methods. With evolution of financial markets, sentiment analysis remain a powerful but nuanced tool which requires thoughtful interpretation to support informed and sustainable retail trading decisions. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"

        "content": "### Abstract\n\nWe are all aware of Artificial Intelligence, its usage, how it is transforming every industry etc. So, we can easily say that it is no longer a distant object for us. It is continuously changing every field of domain and with the help of it the finance industry is completely changed. It is actively transforming the whole structure of finance industry that operates today. Various new features have arrived that reform the old long processes of finance industry. From smarter way of investment and faster mode of trading to detection of frauds and personalized services of finance, all can be possible due to the advancement of technology and with help of modern AI tools which are highly tech. AI helps us in making better decisions using the available data. In this blog, we are going to explore how AI helps different areas of finance in a very simple way and help the people to get the answer of why Ai has become an integral part of modern financial industries or systems.\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe concept of finance is always related to numbers and predictions. It always has to manage uncertainty. However, with the time passing, we are continuously dealing with large amount of data at every second. Prices of stocks are changing rapidly. The effect of wars, global events, tension of sanctioning large percentage of tariff on different countries are continuously influencing the financial markets in an instant way and as a result sentiment of investors shifts within minutes. Due to such problems, we can no longer heavily rely on the traditional pre-existing processes or methods. This is where AI comes in. Instead of replacing us, AI works alongside us. The use of AI technology helps in the process of data processing at a very high scale and speed. As a result of it, process of financial decision making becomes more structured and data-driven. AI helps us to get more efficient result which is never possible with traditional old methods.\n\n### How AI helps in making smarter decisions regarding investing?\n\nInvestors, especially the new comers like us, always face the dilemma of uncertainty. We failed to choose the right path of investing and as a result we face a lot of problems in the future. But with the entry of AI, we get a lifeline or breathe of relief. AI help us by reducing our problem. It helps in reducing the uncertainty by analyzing the historical raw data, identifying the trends, and highlighting the possible risks and opportunities associated with a particular stock. Although AI cannot help us in getting perfect results, but it allows us to make our decisions on probabilities rather than on the concept of assumptions. It will lead us in making more disciplined decisions regarding investing and helps in avoiding impulse choices at the time of market volatility.\n\n### AI's role in stock market trading\n\nDue to the faster movement of stock markets, AI performs well here as both have same dynamic nature of speed. AI powered trading machines continuously track the market trends. When the specific criteria are matched, such systems will automatically execute the trades within milliseconds of time. This is very much helpful in the field of algorithmic trading, where accuracy and timing are very much crucial.\n\n### AI's role in risk management\n\nNone of the trader, investor, financer can avoid risk while doing the job of financial marketing or investing or trading. Risk is an inevitable part of finance which none of us can avoid, but we can manage it using AI. AI analyzes past market crashes and simulates different possible economic scenarios. By doing so, it gives us an estimation of potential economic losses before they actually occur. This helps us to get prepare rather than making any panic situation. By moving from reacting to change in market toward anticipating them, AI helps in improving long term financial stability.\n\n### Detection of frauds and security of finance\n\nRisk of frequent frauds has increased due to increase in digital transactions. But AI is here to protect us. It protects our financial systems by monitoring all transactions at all times. Modern AI fraud systems can easily detect any unusual activity as it first learns what normal behavior of human looks like, then it matches with the present activity. If unusual changes come then it will detect it and alert us. As a result, no damage occurs. It leads to strengthens our trust in digital payment and banking.\n\n### Customized Financial Experiences\n\nAI has transformed the mode of interaction which we did in the past with the financial services. Instead of receiving advices, we are now getting personalized insights which are completely based on our habits of spending, patterns of our money saving and investment behavior. This allows financial planning easier for every user, especially for the new comers. From now on, we are able to track our finances in a more efficient way and can make more smarter choices without giving much effort.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAI is not transforming finance overnight, but it is quietly changing the way we think and make financial decisions. By enhancing investment analysis, increasing the efficiency of trading, improving the risk management systems and enabling personalized financial insights, AI has become an integral part of today’s modern financial systems. With the trend of continuous progress of technology and expanding of data, our reliance on AI will increase even more. For all of us, those in finance, understanding the role of AI and getting comfortable with AI is no longer a choice- it’s now a necessity.\n"

        "content": "### Abstract\n\nOverall accuracy is not enough to evaluate early predictive models in stock markets. The importance of recall and precision in the measurement of performance of the model is explored in this article along with their relevance on investment and trading decisions.\n\n### Introduction\n\nStock market analysis involves the widespread use of machine learning models for identification of trading signals, risk management and prediction of price movements. Accurate evaluation of their performance becomes critical as these models keep on influencing real financial decisions. It often fails to capture the real effectiveness of a model involved with real world trading scenarios despite commonly referencing the overall accuracy.\n\nFalse signals tend to be costly in prediction of stocks. A model missing genuine opportunities can reduce returns while a failing model that frequently predicts profitable trades can lead to financial losses. This marks the emergence of recall and precision as performance metrics that are highly essential. They provide a deeper understanding of how well the model handles incorrect and correct predictions, especially in volatile and imbalanced datasets.\n\nThe meaning of recall and precision, their practical implications in the modeling of stock market and their trade-offs are examined in this article. Analysts and traders can select models that align with their trading objectives and tolerance of risk after understanding these metrics.\n\n### Accuracy of Model in Stock Prediction\n\nThe proportion of correct predictions made by a model is measured by accuracy. Despite simple interpretation, accuracy can be a misleading point in stock market applications whereas the events that are profitable may be extremely rare. For example, a model may fail to identify trading opportunities that are meaningful while also achieving high accuracy, even if a model predicts “no price increase” for most of the time.\n\nSignificant price movements are less frequent than stable periods in stock datasets suffering from class imbalance. Accuracy does not fully reflect the usefulness of the model in such cases. To evaluate the right predictions made by the model, more subtle metrics are required other than the most common ones.\n\nRecall and precision focus on the completeness and quality of positive predictions, thereby addressing these limitations.\n\n### Precision of Stock Market Models\n\nPrecision counts the number of positive predictions made by the model that are correct. Precision answers the question in a stock trading concept: How often is a model right while predicting a profitable trade?\n\nTraders wanting to minimize false signals give particular importance to high precision. Trades based on incorrect predictions upon entering can result in losses, high cost of transactions and confidence reduction of the model. Precision becomes a key metric for strategies involving short term trading or high capital exposure.\n\nHowever, high precision of a model may result in the model becoming overly selective which further leads to fewer trading signals and potentially missing highly profitable opportunities. Proper balance must be maintained between precision and other performance measures.\n\n### Recall of Stock Market Models\n\nThe number of actual positive cases successfully identified by the model is measured by recall. The profit capturing ability of a model is reflected by the recall of stock prediction.\n\nTraders prioritizing opportunity detection value a high recall model. Examples of such traders include breakout traders or momentum. Entering few trades that are unprofitable is cheaper than missing a strong upward movement, which further makes recall a crucial metric in certain strategies.\n\nHeavy focus on recall also results in an increased number of false positives. Risk and trading frequency can consequently increase as a model that captures most opportunities may also generate multiple incorrect signals.\n\n### Precision-Recall Interchange in Trading Strategies\n\nAn inverse relationship is observed between recall and precision. Traders are required to make strategic decisions based on their objectives as improving one may reduce the other. To avoid unnecessary trades, investors who are conservative may favor precision whereas recall may be favored by aggressive traders to maximize exposure to potential gains.\n\nIn case of automated trading systems, where models can execute decisions in absence of human intervention, this interchange has poignant value. The alignment of the model with risk management framework and intended trading style is ensured by selecting an appropriate balance.\n\nCombined metrics or evaluation of precision-recall curves like the F1-score can help in more effective assessment of the entire model by the analysts without relying on only accuracy.\n\n### Practical Implications for Institutional Traders and Retail\n\nUnderstanding recall and precision by retail traders leads to more informed use of predictive tools. Model-based signals are now provided by many trading platforms, but awareness of these metrics is required to interpret their reliability. Blindly trusting model outputs with no context of performance may lead to poor outcomes.\n\nQuantitative analysts and institutional traders have heavy reliance on precision and recall, especially during model validation and development. Model optimization, back testing and deployment are guided by these metrics which ensure that genuine values are added by predictions to trading strategies.\n\nThus, technical model performance is translated into practical and financial decision making by recall and precision.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nMeasurement of model accuracy in prediction of stock markets extends beyond metrics of simple accuracy. Critical insight is provided by precision and recall into how a model can effectively identify trades that are profitable and avoid false signals. Different trading objectives are served by each metric, which further makes their balance essential for successfully deploying the model.\n\nBetter understanding and application of precision and recall help traders and analysts align predictive models with strategic goals and tolerance of risk. As machine learning continuously shapes financial markets, thoughtfully evaluating these metrics keep on being central to building highly sustainable and reliable trading systems."

The Robustness of the models against the malicious attack is very paramount. In this article We will investigate Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) Which focused on Inputs Which are Specially crafted to cheat The Neural Networks. We will explore The mathematical Explanation of The Fast Gradient Sign Method(FGSM) which will demonstrate that how a noise which is imperceptible can effect a misclassification which is catastrophic and we will also explore some defence strategies to make AI systems much harder against those Vulnerabilities.\n\n### Introduction\n\nLet us Take an example a car Which is Autodrive mode is approaching to a red sign. For a human It basically Looks very normal But In a computer vision of the car System Some relevant Stickers on that sign can make it Watch like Sign Of speed limit 45 So if the car will accelerate It may cause an accident. Show this scenario Is not theoretical It is a type of attack Which is Model Evasion.\n\nFor long years Cyber Security is focusing on securing to secure The Firewalls And the patching bugs. But Now a days We are facing a new problem which is the mathematics. Neural Networks perform much sensitive for small trouble Into data Which is taking as input. These things are Invisible often to our eyes to push Input to the Models Decision boundary Which is high dimensional which will force A confident prediction But it is wrong.\n\nThe article will scrap all layers of the neural network to describe that how those attacks work and how we will calculate the perfect noise mathematically to break the model.\n\nWe are calling it as the Invisible Hack because the attack will exploit the fundamental differences between mathematical processing and biological vision. It is invisible to humans because the noise which was added to an image which is controlled by epsilon parameter is extremely small(Exa:-0.006). In our eyes, pixels shifts so much slightly that “Hacked Bear” will look exactly identical to “Normal Bear”.\n\nThough humans ignore some small noises AI will calculate each and every single value of pixel. This attack pushes an image data to over the Decision Boundary which is mathematical in the vector space of model. AI does not just confused it will trick into being wrong confidentially.\n\n### Mathematical Description\n\nWe does not need the server access to hack any neural network. We will need to understand the Gradient Descent just.\n\nNormally when we train our model we have to minimize loss function by adjusting weights\n\n**Training Goal:**\n$$ \\min_{\\theta} J(\\theta, x, y) $$\n\nIn the adversarial attack when we flip secret bit we will freeze weights and modify the input image to maximum the loss. This techniques is called Gradient Ascent. We have used the common algorithm which is mostly used is Fast Gradient Sign Method(FGSM). This is introduced by famous Goodfellow.\n\nNow we are going to calculate the noise as:\n\n$$ \\eta = \\epsilon \\cdot \\text{sign}(\\nabla_x J(\\theta, x, y)) $$\n\n**Where:**\n*   $\\theta$: The fixed model parameters.\n*   $x$: The original input (e.g., an image of a Panda).\n*   $y$: The correct label (\"Panda\").\n*   $\\epsilon$ (Epsilon): A small multiplier ensuring the noise remains invisible to humans.\n*   $\\nabla_x J$: The gradient of the loss with respect to the *input pixels*.\n\nThe final \"Adversarial Image\" $x'$ becomes:\n\n$$ x' = x + \\eta $$\n\n### Code\n\nThis pseudocode describes that how the attack is generated by using the pretrained model\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\n# 1. The FGSM Attack Function\ndef fgsm_attack(image, epsilon, data_grad):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates adversarial noise to deceive the model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the sign of the gradients (direction to increase error)\n    sign_data_grad = data_grad.sign()\n\n    # Create the noise (perturbation)\n    # Equation: eta = epsilon * sign(gradient)\n    perturbed_image = image + epsilon * sign_data_grad\n\n    # Clip to maintain valid image range [0,1]\n    perturbed_image = torch.clamp(perturbed_image, 0, 1)\n\n    return perturbed_image\n\n# 2. Execution Logic\ndef attack_model(model, data, target, epsilon):\n    # Set require_grad attribute of tensor to True\n    data.requires_grad = True\n\n    # Forward pass: Ask the model what it sees\n    output = model(data)\n\n    # Calculate Loss (Cross Entropy)\n    # We want to MAXIMIZE this loss\n    loss = F.nll_loss(output, target)\n\n    # Zero all existing gradients\n    model.zero_grad()\n\n    # Backward pass: Calculate gradients of loss w.r.t input data\n    loss.backward()\n\n    # Collect the data gradients (nabla_x)\n    data_grad = data.grad.data\n\n    # Call FGSM function\n    perturbed_data = fgsm_attack(data, epsilon, data_grad)\n\n    return perturbed_data\n```\n\n### Defence\n\nNow imagine if we are able to know that the models which are vulnerable for some special mathematical noise then the mostly used logical based defence will be to include that noise which come out and put it in the training Process. This process is also called Adversarial Training. Imagine it as a vaccine. We intentionally infecting the model with virus(Adversarial Example) in weekends during training so the immune system(Decision Boundary) of it starts to learning how to recognize and resist them.\n\n### Min-Max Game\n\nIf we train a model on standard basis then it will minimize the loss of clean data. By doing adversarial training we can transform it to a Min Max Game. We have to find weights to minimize loss by giving an adversary and then we have to try constantly to find permutation that maximize it.\n\n$$ \\min_{\\theta} \\mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \\sim \\mathcal{D}} \\left[ \\max_{\\delta \\in S} L(\\theta, x + \\delta, y) \\right] $$\n\nInner Maximization(max):- Here the attacker will try to search the noise which is so much noised to maximum the error.\n\nOuter Maximization(min):- Here the defender will try to update the weights to minimum high error.\n\n### Code\n\nThis pseudocode describes that how to defence the attack\n\n```python\ndef train_robust_model(model, train_loader, optimizer, epsilon=0.1):\n    model.train()\n    for data, target in train_loader:\n        # 1. Generate the Attack (The \"Vaccine\")\n        data.requires_grad = True\n        output = model(data)\n        loss = F.nll_loss(output, target)\n        model.zero_grad()\n        loss.backward()\n\n        # Create the adversarial image\n        data_grad = data.grad.data\n        perturbed_data = data + epsilon * data_grad.sign()\n        perturbed_data = torch.clamp(perturbed_data, 0, 1)\n\n        # 2. Train on the Attack (The \"Immunity\")\n        optimizer.zero_grad()\n        # Feed the BROKEN image to the model, but force it to learn the CORRECT label\n        output_adv = model(perturbed_data)\n        loss_adv = F.nll_loss(output_adv, target)\n        loss_adv.backward()\n        optimizer.step()\n    print(\"Robust training epoch complete.\")\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAdversarial Machine Learning already exposed a hard reality which is that AI models are breakable. As we are integrating AI into Cybersecurity by Threat Detection and Zero Trust we should remember that defenders means AI models can make themselves tricked. In The next Few Years the cybersecurity will not just stucked to encryption or firewalls. It will also able to build Robust AI models which can fight back mathematical questions and functional dependencies though the world tries to cheat them."

In our case our complete vibescore calculation gets biased towards positive news we solved that problem in our news search\n\n\n\n### Body:\n\n\n\nwhile extracting news and testing the vibe score for our finsense web app we found out a major flaw the news we were getting were mostly positive no negative or bad news were being taken by the news scraper which led to the vibe score being very high at all occasion despite there being few negative news.\n\n\n\nwhat we realized was that the news we were getting was the regular news ment for  people to read wich is intentionally optimized for relevance and clicks but for finsense we needed  raw unfiltered news that was not only positive but also gave all relevant negative news. For this we implemented a solution where when a user search for a stock lets say Tata Motors we implement the **Contrarian search protocol**\n\n\n\n#### **Contrarian Search Protocol:**\n\n\n\nevery time user search a stock like Tata Motors finsense actually tiggers two simultaneous parallel search:\n\n\n\n1. **The Bull Search :** 'q=Tata Motors' (standard news, volume, price action)\n2. **The Bear Search :** `q=Tata Motors (fraud OR scam OR investigation OR decline OR plunge OR court)`\n\n\n\nwe use JavaScript's 'Promise.all' to fire  these requests concurrently, ensuringg zero latency penalty for user. \n\n\n\nthen comes the merge and dedupe phase\n\n\n\n```typescript\n\n// The \"Risk Hunter\" Pattern\n\nconst riskKeywords = \" (fraud OR investigation OR drop OR loss OR scam)\";\n\nconst [standardResults, riskResults] = await Promise.all([\n\n &nbsp;   fetchNews(query),\n\n &nbsp;   fetchNews(query + riskKeywords) // The Contrarian Query\n\n]);\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nTo merge and dedupelicate a simple url chck iss i=not enough because same story may be output of normal search and negative search but also same news may appear in multiple websites the  same blog in different url for that\n\n\n\nwe implementerd **Jaccard Similarity Index** for text based deduplication\n\n\n\n1.

        "content": "### Abstract\n\nWhen I starts my studies for Deep Learning, all the shortforms I felt very puzzled. The two most that puzzled my studies is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). When I heard first these 2 names I thought those are black boxes which are interchangeable. However after all studies I realized that those 2 things represents two different ways of thinking fundamentally. One is Temporal and another one is spatial. I will share my way of thinking about these 2 architectures in this article. I will use these 2 nicknames “The Eye” and “The Memory” to make these 2 concepts better understandable.\n\n### Introduction\n\nIn my studies first understanding about neural network is simple Feed Forward Network. When I understood it perfectly It became very easy. I will describe you in a easy way. Just the input enters, magic happens internally, output came out. As simple as that.\n\nBut as you know that our Real word is not so simple. Images contain structures, sentences contain sequences. When I try to apply a network which is standard to these type of problems then it fails sadly. At that time I discover that we will need some specialized models to handle these types of specific datasets.\n\nThe two main things in Neural Networks are CNN & RNN. For long time, I struggle so much to find the the correct scenario that when to apply CNN and when RNN. It was not until and unless I stop for looking to math and starts to look to the philosophy of architecture which it clicked.\n\n### CNN\n\nAfter studying about convolution Neural Network I clearly understand that this function exactly do the job like our eyes. When I carefully look to a cat in photo, I do not scan each and every pixel in straight line. Instead that I look to the features like sharp ear, curve tail and relevant textures.\n\nActually CNN is basically Convolution Operation. For me, it is just the imagination term for sliding window. AT first we have to take a small filter which is called Kernel and we have to slide it through the full image to watch that a specific feature will exist or not.\n\nSo if we represented it mathematically then the equation will be\n\n$$ Y(i,j) = (X * W)(i,j) = \\sum_{m} \\sum_{n} X(i+m, j+n) \\cdot W(m,n) $$\n\nW :- Pattern Matcher\n\nX :- The pixels\n\nSo in my prospective, if the pattern matches with pixels then output is high. If not then output is low. That is why CNNs are Spatially Invariant. That’s why the can easily find an animal no matter it is to the top left corner or bottom right corner.\n\nWe can use CNN for cases like Object Detection, Image Classification & Analysing Grid Data.\n\n### RNN\n\nAs per previous discussion I thing you understand that though CNN perform great at watching purposes but I have learned they are very poor at reading. Suppose I show any sentence to CNN “The taste of the food was very bad but the service was good” Then it is treating each and every word as the island which is isolated. It surely not understand that a word “but” can flip the sentiment of the sentence.\n\nThus Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) changed my way of thinking. After so much learning I understand that RNN is basically a Memory of the AI. In other networks they start taking fresh inputs after taking every inputs, but RNN keep the “Hidden State” which is basically a notepad where it writes all the things which it had seen previously.\n\nSo if we represented it mathematically then the equation will be\n\n$$ h_t = \\tanh(W_h h_{t-1} + W_x x_t) $$\n\nHere,\n\nxt :- Current Input\n\nht-1 :- Memory for previous step\n\nFor me, the equation is telling that currently my thinking is the mixture of what I am just watching and I just though a few seconds ago. This helps model to perfectly understand the sequence and the context. We use RNN in cases of Time Series Prediction(Exa:- Stock Markets), Text Generation, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Video Processing.\n\n### Code\n\n```python\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass MyCNN(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(MyCNN, self).__init__()\n        # Looking at 3x3 pixel squares\n        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        return self.conv1(x)\n\nclass MyRNN(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):\n        super(MyRNN, self).__init__()\n        # Processing sequences\n        self.rnn = nn.RNN(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        # We get an output AND the final memory state\n        out, hidden = self.rnn(x)\n        return out, hidden\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter spending all the time by studying CNN and RNN, at last I have stopped to ask myself Which Network performs Better and started to ask myself What is actually the Data of the networks?\n\nFrom my way of thinking,\n\nIf the data looks like Grid(Exa :- Board Games or Pixels) then I will definitely search for CNN.\n\nIf the data looks like Sequence(Exa:- Audio, Words, Time) then I will definitely search for RNN.\n\nThough we definitely know that our world is moving very fast from old technologies to new innovative advantaged Technologies. Engineers are putting RNN to many tasks. So finally I want to tell you that In my education difference between CNN (Spatial Processing) and RNN (Sequential Processing) was the most vital step."

        "content": "### Abstract\n\nQuantum computation's entry is considered to be the next breakthrough in the field of \n\ninnovation. Scientists often believe that it is going be the next revolutionary leap in the \n\ninformation technology sector. But for many of the people, especially for the new comers like \n\nus, it still feels very much puzzling and distant due to the absence of prior knowledge. We \n\nhear a lot of bold claims about the transformation of industries due to the entry of Quantum \n\nComputing, while we are also told at the same time that the technology is still far from being \n\nfully ready. This blog will provide us a complete look at quantum computing by exploring the \n\nhopes surrounding it, the hype that inflates expectations, and the reality of the current state \n\nof technology.\n\n&nbsp; \n\n### Introduction \n\nNowadays Quantum computing has become one of the most discussed topics in the modern \n\nworld of technology. We witness a lot of news headlines where the predictors are claiming \n\nthat it will change all—from cybersecurity field to medicine sector —while others believe it as \n\nhype-driven science. As readers, we’re often failed to choose the right topic on which we can \n\nbelieve. Is quantum computing really the future, or is it just another trendy term carried by \n\nhype? To answer that, we need to pause and look at both its limits and its promises with a \n\nclear vision.  \n\n### The Hope regarding Quantum Computing \n\nThere is a lot of excitement regarding quantum computing and thereexists a reason behind \n\nthis excitement. Unlike classical based computers, which process  linear way of information \n\npassing, quantum computers can find or explore various possibilities at a time. This opens \n\nthe door of solving extreme level of  complex problems. We may see significant \n\nbreakthroughs in areas like discovery of drugs, material science, simulation of climate, and \n\ncomplex optimization problems that are currently beyond the capability of classical machines \n\nto solve them. When we estimate about these possibilities, it’s easy to understand why both \n\nthe tech companies and researchers are so much excited and hopeful about it . The hope is \n\nnot imaginary—it is supported by real and solid scientific principles. \n\n### The Hype that makes people confusing \n\nHowever, the news and the hype around the quantum computation often creates a lot of \n\nexpectations which seems to be unrealistic in nature. A lot of articles suggest that quantum \n\ncomputers are just around the corner and are ready to replace our daily devices or instantly \n\nbreak all the existing encryption models. That’s simply not true. We cannot say that Quantum \n\ncomputing is a just “faster computing,” and it will not solve each and every problem in a \n\nsurprising manner. When we start mixing up the possibilities of future with the one that are \n\nexisting today, we lead us to the confusion of real progress with the unfulfilled promises. All \n\nthis can lead people, like us,  to think either in an overly excited way or in a complete \n\ndoubtful way.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### The current state of Quantum Computing which Stands Today\n\nIn real, in the present time, quantum computing is still in its experimental phase. Current \n\nquantum based systems are very much weak and also they are highly sensitive in nature. \n\nEven small piece of disturbances can cause a lot of errors, which lead to difficulty in making \n\nreliable computation. At present, most of the quantum based computers are used in \n\nresearch based labs rather than in the real-world applications. We are still working on \n\nbuilding of stable machines, reduce the level of errors, and scale them in an effective way. \n\nProgress is underway, but at a slow careful pace, and far from becoming a widespread \n\nadoption. \n\n### What the upcoming Future Might  Look Like \n\nInstead of waiting and expecting a sudden quantum breakthrough, we should focus on a \n\nsteady process for expecting a gradual change. In the coming days, quantum computers are \n\nmore likely to operate alongside the classical computers instead of replacing them. We may \n\nwitness a revolution where new types of hybrid systems will be introduced in the field of \n\ntechnology. These hybrid models will contain both quantum and classical systems, where \n\nquantum part will handle the specific, complex works while classical systems manage the \n\nrest. This practical approach is more reasonable than the quantum technology that we are \n\nassuming to take overnight. Their progress is expected to follow a slow path, in a \n\nstep-by-step trajectory rather than a sudden transformation. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe can view quantum computing as a field of real promise and as a balance between \n\nexcitement and reality. It remains powerful in potential, realistic in its pace and driven by \n\nauthentic or real research."

        "content": "### ABSTRACT:\n\nWhen the financial data is collected, it does not become useful instantly at that moment. The process of transforming raw market feeds into structured, reliable datasets using data pipelines is explained in this article which further highlights considerations of designs and key challenges involved in the process.\n\n### INTRODUCTION:\n\nData is continuously generated from multiple sources like exchanges, APIs, alternative data providers and web platforms. Unpredictable corporate actions like update of prices in milliseconds and real time evolution of market news can occur. However, in its original form raw financial data is rarely ready for decision-making or direct analysis.\n\nBefore building any risk model, strategy of trading and analytical insights, proper passage of this data must be ensured through a well-designed pipeline. Noisy, fragmented and inconsistent inputs are transformed into trustworthy and standardized datasets through these pipelines. Errors at this stage can propagate downstream, which may further lead to flawed financial decisions and misleading insights.\n\nAll the phases in the lifecycle of financial data – from ingestion to validation and other designs and challenges required for consideration when a robust financial data pipeline is built, are explored in this article.\n\n### RAW FINANCIAL DATA AND ITS SOURCES:\n\nThere can be several sources from which financial data originates. Each source has their own structures and limitations. APIs provided by data providers deliver fundamentals, historical prices and corporate actions whereas volume data and high-frequency prices are provided by exchange feeds. Social media sentiment, news feeds and macroeconomic releases which constitute alternative data sources further add complexity, despite increasing complexity.\n\nThese sources differ not only in formats but also in symbol definitions, conventions of timestamps and frequencies of updates. If they are combined without handling carefully, inconsistencies that distort analytical outcomes will be obtained as consequences. Whether a data source is reliable or not requires understanding the nature of the data source and this is the first step of a reliable data pipeline.\n\n### CHALLENGES OF STREAMING AND INGESTION OF DATA:\n\nCollection of data in batch mode or real time is done by the ingestion layer. Arrival of market feeds happen at high velocity, particularly in high frequency or intraday environments. Common challenges during ingestion consist of duplicate messages, delayed updates or packets that are missing.\n\nFault tolerance must be a major property of streaming architectures which must be capable of handling data bursts while ensuring that no loss occurs. Several factors become critical at this stage which are required to preserve data integrity. These factors consist of maintaining latency constraints, managing failover mechanisms and ensuring message ordering.\n\n### NORMALIZATION AND CLEANING OF DATA:\n\nIncorrect prices, missing values, record that are duplicated and symbols that are inconsistent are common constituents of raw financial data. Splits of stock, mergers, dividends and changes of ticker result in more complexity that should be handled carefully.\n\nData from different sources should follow a unified schema and this is ensured by normalization which includes aligning formats of price, standardizing timestamps across time zones and mapping symbols consistently over time. Simple analytical queries can result in misleading consequences in absence of this step.\n\n### STORAGE AND MODELING OF DATA:\n\nAfter cleaning, financial data must be stored in a way that supports both real-time access and historical analysis. Depending on latency and query requirements, warehouses of data, time-series databases and lakes of data find the most common use.\n\nProperly modelling the data is extremely important. To ensure accurate reconstruction of the previous market states by models and analysts, time partitioning, indexing key identifiers and maintaining historical versions of records are extremely important tasks. Scalability gets limited and analytical workflows get slowed down due to poor storage design.\n\n### QUALITY CHECKS AND VALIDATION:\n\nThe final safeguard in the pipeline is validation. The falling of price within logical ranges, consistent volumes and correct alignment of timestamps are ensured by this stage. Anomalies can be detected by cross checking against reference data, before they reach the systems present in the downstream level.\n\nIn finance, trading decisions or risk calculations can be influenced by even minor data errors and consequently automated quality checks are very important. Data quality is continuously monitored by reliable pipelines rather than treating validation as a one-time process.\n\n### DESIGN CHALLENGES FACED BY COMMON PIPELINE:\n\nSpeed, scalability and accuracy must be balanced by financial data pipelines. Low latency is often prioritized by high-frequency systems whereas historical accuracy and completeness are emphasised by pipelines that are research oriented. It is often impractical to design a single pipeline that satisfies all use cases.\n\nTransparency and reproducibility are demanded by additional regulatory requirements. Data lineage must be tracked by pipelines to provide clear audit trails which further ensures that analytical results can be traced back to their original sources.\n\n### CONCLUSION:\n\nA foundational step in any financial system is transforming raw market feeds into usable insights. Data pipelines that are well-designed ensure the accuracy and consistency of the financial data to ensure that it is ready for analysis before reaching models or decision-makers. Each stage plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of data, from ingestion and cleaning to storage and validation.\n\nThe importance of robust data pipelines increases with increasing speed and data-driven nature of financial markets. Investing in strong pipeline architecture not only reduces analytical risks but also enables better strategies, more reliable insights and informed financial decisions."
